# Spring Boot GraphQL API for Employee & Department Management  

## üìñ Overview  

A robust Spring Boot application that exposes **Employee and Department** data via a powerful **GraphQL API**. This service supports complex relationships, including **Employee-Department**, **Employee-Salary**, and **Employee-Title** associations. All API access is securely protected using an API Key passed in the request headers.  


### üí° Why GraphQL ?  

**GraphQL** offers several advantages over traditional **REST APIs**, making it a compelling choice for API development:  

- **Precise Data Retrieval** ‚Äì Clients can request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues common in REST. This leads to more efficient data usage and optimized network performance.  
- **Single Endpoint** ‚Äì Unlike REST, which often requires multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL operates through a single endpoint. This simplifies API interactions and reduces the complexity of managing numerous endpoints.  
- **Flexible and Strongly Typed Schema** ‚Äì GraphQL uses a type system to describe data, allowing clients to understand available data and operations clearly. This enhances development efficiency and reduces errors.  
- **Efficient Data Aggregation** ‚Äì Clients can fetch related data in a single request, minimizing the need for multiple roundtrips to the server. This is particularly beneficial for complex systems where data resides in different sources.  
- **API Evolution Without Versioning** ‚Äì GraphQL enables APIs to evolve by adding new fields and types without impacting existing queries. Deprecated fields can be managed gracefully, reducing the need for versioning.  

These features make GraphQL a powerful alternative to REST, offering more efficient, flexible, and developer-friendly API interactions.

## ü§ñ Tech Stack  

The technology used in this project are:  

- `Spring Boot Starter Web` ‚Äì Provides the foundational web support for the application, enabling HTTP handling and server-side capabilities for GraphQL over HTTP.  
- `Spring Boot Starter GraphQL` ‚Äì Integrates GraphQL Java into the Spring ecosystem.  
- `GraphQL Java Extended Scalars` ‚Äì a library that provides additional scalar types for GraphQL Java, such as `DateTime`, `URL`, and `BigDecimal`.  
- `Spring Boot Starter Validation` ‚Äì Adds support for Java Bean Validation, ensuring the integrity of incoming request data through declarative annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`.  
- `Spring Boot Starter Security` ‚Äì Provides the necessary components for securing the application.  
- `PostgreSQL` ‚Äì Database for persisting employee, department, salary, and title data.  
- `Hibernate` ‚Äì Simplifying database interactions.  
- `Lombok` ‚Äì Reducing boilerplate code.

## ‚öô Environment Configuration  

The application uses externalized configuration via Spring Boot's `application.properties` file, leveraging environment variables to support flexible deployment across different environments (development, staging, production, etc.).  

Below is a breakdown of the key configurations:  

```properties
# Application environment variables
spring.application.name=graphql-employee-management
server.port=${APP_PORT}
spring.profiles.active=${SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE}

# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PORT}/${SPRING_DATASOURCE_DB}?currentSchema=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_SCHEMA}
spring.datasource.username=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}

# API configuration
app.api.key=${APP_API_KEY}
```

You can configure these variables via a `.env` file, CI/CD pipeline, or your host system‚Äôs environment.

## üíæ Database Schema (DDL ‚Äì PostgreSQL)  

The following is the database schema for the PostgreSQL database used in this project:  

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA your_schema;

-- table your_schema.employee
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_schema.employee (
    id bigint NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ( INCREMENT 1 START 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807 CACHE 1 ),
    birth_date date NOT NULL,

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup  

To get started with the **Spring Boot GraphQL API for Employee & Department Management**, follow the steps below to configure your environment properly.  

1. Ensure you have **Git installed on your Windows** machine, then clone the repository to your local environment:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoanesber/Spring-Boot-Graphql-Employee-Management.git
cd Spring-Boot-Graphql-Employee-Management
```

2. Set up PostgreSQL  

The application connects to a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of employee, department, salary, and title data.

- Run the provided DDL script to set up the database schema  
- Ensure the following environment variables are defined before starting the application:  

```properties
# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PORT}/${SPRING_DATASOURCE_DB}?currentSchema=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_SCHEMA}
spring.datasource.username=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
spring.datasource.password=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
```

Once configured, make sure the PostgreSQL instance is running and accessible before starting the Spring Boot application.  

3. API Key Configuration  

To secure access to the GraphQL API, the application requires an API key to be included in each request via the `X-API-KEY` header.  

```properties
# API configuration
app.api.key=${APP_API_KEY}
```

Make sure to set the `APP_API_KEY` environment variable in your local environment, `.env` file, or deployment platform. Requests without a valid API key will receive an authorization error.  

4. Run the application locally  

Make sure PostgreSQL is running, then execute:  

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

5. The server will start at:  

```bash
http://localhost:8080/graphql
```

---

## üß™ Test the GraphQL API  

Once the application is running (at http://localhost:8080/graphql), you can test the GraphQL API using tools like:  

- [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/releases)  
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads)  


All GraphQL requests to this API must include a valid `X-API-KEY` header for authentication. This API key serves as a security mechanism to restrict unauthorized access to the protected resources. When testing queries or mutations using tools like **Postman** or **GraphQL Playground**, make sure to add the following header to every request:  

**Headers:**  

```http
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

**Note:** If the API key is missing or invalid, the server will respond with an authentication error and deny access to the requested operation.  


**Invalid or Missing API Key Response:**  

```json
{
    "error": "Unauthorized: Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

### Department API Endpoints

## üìù Notes & Future Enhancements  

### Current Notes  

- This project is a backend-focused API, intended to manage **Employees** and their relationships with **Departments, Salaries, and Titles** using **GraphQL**.  
- All operations are protected by a lightweight API key mechanism using the `X-API-KEY` header.  
- The schema and DTOs are kept clean and follow **GraphQL best practices** for separation of input and output types.  
- DTO input fields are validated using **Java Bean Validation (JSR-380)** annotations such as `@NotBlank`, `@NotNull`, and custom constraints to ensure data integrity at the API level.  
- Validation errors are consistently handled through a custom `GraphQLExceptionConfig`, which transforms exceptions into structured and informative GraphQL error responses.  
- Clean architecture and clear separation of concerns are implemented using service layers, DTO mappings, and repository abstraction.  

### Planned Enhancements  

- **OAuth2 / JWT Security Integration**  

Replace the static API key mechanism with **OAuth2** or **JWT-based authentication** using Spring Security. This will enhance scalability, token expiration control, and multi-user access management.  

- **GraphQL Subscriptions**  

Implement **GraphQL subscriptions** to enable real-time notifications when an employee is created, updated, or deleted. This would be useful for reactive client-side applications.
